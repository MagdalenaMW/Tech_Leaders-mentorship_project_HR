### I took part in a mentoring programme for women in IT. As part of my meetings with the mentor, I worked on an analytics project where I analysed a large dataset, looked for correlations and created visualisations of the results.


## 💼 HR Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on workforce insights, including employee satisfaction, headcount structure, and turnover trends. Data was analyzed and visualized using Python, and Google Colab to support data-driven decisions in human resources.
